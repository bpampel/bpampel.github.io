This is a short personal website.
No commercial interests, no warranty for anything written here.

If you are interested in how the site is build:  
The pages are written in Markdown and the respective HTML website is automatically generated by a static site generator ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) every time I push to github (using [github actions](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)).
Everything is hosted at github pages and the domain is redirected there.
There will be an upcoming post specifying more details in my collection of [random notes](/zettel/).
