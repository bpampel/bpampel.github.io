I'm a physicist currently working as researcher at the sustainable energy grids group of the [Fraunhofer IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/) in NÃ¼rnberg.

My previous research at the [MPI-P](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/) in Mainz focused on developing new computational methods to better understand soft matter phenomena.

You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/c4477cc598e841509d46/).

Also, the two associated papers on VES with Wavelets ([JCTC](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00197)) and Birth-death augmented sampling ([Phys Rev E](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.107.024141)) are published with open access.
