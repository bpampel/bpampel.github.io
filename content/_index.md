This is a short personal website of Benjamin Pampel.

I'm a physicist currently working as doctoral researcher at the [MPI-P](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/) in Mainz.

My research focuses on developing new computational methods to better understand soft matter phenomena.

The first part of my PhD research has now been submitted for publication and is up on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13459](arXiv)!
