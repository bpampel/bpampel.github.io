I'm a physicist currently working as researcher at the sustainable energy grids group of the [Fraunhofer IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/) in NÃ¼rnberg.

My previous research at the [MPI-P](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/) in Mainz focused on developing new computational methods to better understand soft matter phenomena.

You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/c4477cc598e841509d46/).

Also, the first part of my PhD research has been [published in JCTC]( https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00197) and is freely accessible.
